# ThePlanets

The goal of the project is to be a kind of "observatory" where you will sample the characteristics, curiosities and images of the planets, initially you will only have our solar system, but in the future I plan to develop an API in NODE where other solar systems can be implemented.

When the application design is ready, I will add it to the project and start the coding.
